Fallout Dialogue Creator Readme

v0.29-beta

(c) 2005-2025 T. Pitkänen

Fallout Dialogue Creator is a new kind of a modding tool
aimed mostly at creating dialogues with relative ease.
As some of my other tools for other games (Arcanum, for
example), this one features a plugin interface complete
with a Software Development Kit (APIs for C and Delphi)
for increased extensibility.

Dialogues can be exported as SSL scripts along with their
message files for later compiling.

The tool has a help file linked to it (accessed with 
F1 or Help->Dialogue Tool Help)
